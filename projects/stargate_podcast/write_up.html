							<p>The years of 2022 and 2023 will haunt the nightmares of major movie studios for decades to come. Not only are two unions striking (effectively grinding 
								the industry to a halt), a record number of movie releases have failed to turn a profit. It's estimated that Disney has lost 
								a whopping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNgbuv6wVPc" target="_blank"> $890 Million </a> on only eight movies released in the span of 
								just 12 months! And Disney is certainly not alone. DreamWorks spent $70 Million on an animated movie called "Teenage Kraken" and only managed a 
								poor $40 Million at the box office. And after a staggering 9 years of production hell, Warner Bros finally released "The Flash" on a $200 Million 
								budget. In one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, it only managed to rake in $268 Million (more on why this is so dreadful later). 
							</p>

							<p>In light of the disaster that is Hollywood right now, I thought it would be a fun exercise to scientifically craft the most profitable film possible. 
								Maybe the big studios will take my advice on their next movies! When they're allowed to film again, that is. Our experiment starts with a database 
								of movies, which anybody can find here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies" target="_blank"> 
								Movies Daily Update Dataset </a>. 
							</p>
							<p style="margin:0;">Our first order of business is data exploration and data cleaning. And wow, does this data need some work.
								<ul>
									<li>
										We start by filtering our data to only include english movies, as we are focusing on the Hollywood industry.
									</li>
									<li>
										Similarly, we will filter the data to only include movies that have actually been released, as movies need to have been released 
										to make a profit.
									</li>
									<li>
										Next, lets limit our movies to between 
										<a href="https://www.oscars.org/sites/oscars/files/96o_complete_rules.pdf" target="_blank">40 minutes</a> (according to the Oscar's eligibility 
										rules for the length of a movie) and 
										<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/what-is-the-longest-movie-ever-made-marvel-harry-potter-disney-star-wars-more-2012837/#:~:text=While%20the%20Guinness%20World%20Records%20say%20the%20longest%20movie%20ever%20made%20is%201987%E2%80%99s%20The%20Cure%20of%20Insomnia%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20actually%20Amra%20Ekta%20Cinema%20Banabo%2C%20also%20known%20as%20The%20Innocence.%C2%A0" target="_blank">1265 minutes</a> (longest theatrical movie ever made).
									</li>
									<li>
										Now we take care of the upper and lower bounds for budget, which are filled with errors. So many in fact, that I cannot go through 
										them all by hand. To combat this, I am cutting off any movie that has a budget lower than 
										<a href="https://movieweb.com/cheapest-movies-ever-made" target="_blank">$218</a>, as any studio could more than afford to fund such a film. I am
										also cutting off any movie with a budget larger than <a href="https://boardroom.tv/most-expensive-movies-ever-made-avatar-marvel/" target="_blank">
											$460 million</a>, as a quick google search shows that this is the all-time largest budget for a movie.
									</li>
									<li>
										On the flip side, I'm going to restrict our data set to movies that have made over 1 million dollars. This is an arbitrary cut-off point and 
										can be adjusted, but I felt it was a nice breakpoint to ensure that all movies we analyze had even a modicum of success.  
									</li>
									<li>
										Finally, we have to look at all null values still present in the data. Due to the fact that most of the nulls present are from features I 
										intend to drop (the remaining nulls make up less than 1% of our datapoints) I have elected to drop all null rows. At least we have uber-clean 
										data now, right?   
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<h3>Features That Will Be Dropped</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><b>id:</b> An identification number that comes from the creation of the database. Not very useful to us.  </li>
								<li><b>original_language:</b> The language the film was made in. As discussed, we can now drop this column due to it only containing english movies. </li>
								<li><b>overview:</b> A summary of the movie. As we are looking for characteristics, this is not helpful. </li>
								<li><b>popularity:</b> A score given by the database which represents acclaim. While this sounds beneficial, we only care about profitibility in this 
									experiment, not popularity. </li>
								<li><b>production_companies:</b> A list of production companies involved in each film. Our perfect film should be studio-independent, so that anyone can 
									profit from the work done here. &#128521;</li>
								<li><b>status:</b> Indicates whether the movie has been released, is planned, has been cancelled, etc. As discussed, we can now drop this column due to 
									it only containing released movies. </li>
								<li><b>tagline:</b> The tagline of the movie. (Who could have guessed?) I'm already telling Hollywood how to make the perfect movie, I'm not marketing it 
									for them too! </li>
								<li><b>vote_average:</b> See popularity.</li>
								<li><b>vote_count:</b> See popularity.</li>
								<li><b>credts:</b> A list of actors involved with the film. </li>
								<li><b>poster_path:</b> A route to find the poster for the movie. As you can imagine, not useful. </li>
								<li><b>keywords:</b> A list of words/phrases that describe the movie. </li>
								<li><b>backdrop_path:</b> See poster_path. </li>
								<li><b>recommendations:</b> A list of id's for silimar movies. This could be interesting to derive for myself in a future project, but that's not why we're
									here today. </li>
							</ul>
							
							<p style="margin: 0;">
								Next on the list is the conversion of our release_date and genre features! Both of these features started as a string with individual entries separated 
								by dashes. It will be much easier to work with the release_date data if we convert it to a datetime object. Likewise, it will be much easier to work with 
								the genre data if we convert the string to a list of applicable genres. <br> <br>
								Now, we have just one more step before the cool graphs, I promise! It is generally agreed that a movie must make 
								<a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-much-money-does-a-movie-need-to-make-to-be-profitab-5747305#:~:text=a%20rule%20of%20thumb%20seems%20to%20be%20that%20the%20film%20needs%20to%20make%20twice%20its%20production%20budget%20globally." target="_blank">
									twice it's budget in revenue to be profitable</a>, so I will be adding a column to denote whether a movie has passed this 
									threshold. This is a slice of what our data looks like now that we're done processing it: 
									<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/movie_analysis/head1.png" alt="" /></span>
									Using this new feature, I can make a graph like this! Each yellow dot represents one profitiable movie, and each blue corresponds to one that didn't 
									manage to make it's money back. I also plotted a line of best fit for all the data, represented in black. This tells us that there is a correlation 
									positive between budget and revenue. I guess the old addage "you have to spend money to make money" is true when it comes to making movies! 
							</p>
							<span class="image center graph" ><img src="../../images/movie_analysis/budget_vs_revenue.png" alt="" /></span>


							<p style="margin: 0;">
								Next, I decided to see how the runtime of a movie might affect it's revenue. Same as before, yellow is profitiable movies, and blue is unprofitable. When
								I plotted these two groups and found the average runtime, I was surprised to find basically no difference! There is less than a minute difference between 
								the two categories. This is when I decided to create a third section, comprised of the top 50 all time highest grossing movies, represented by the red dots. 
								This is where the interesting number appears! The average runtime of the most successful movies was about 26 minutes longer than the average of all movies. So 
								for any movie producers out there, aim for a 2 hours and 15 minute runtime! 
							</p>
							<span class="image center graph" ><img src="../../images/movie_analysis/runtimes_vs_revenue.png" alt="" /></span>


							<p style="margin: 0;">
								The next feature I wanted to look at is the release date, specifically the month films were released in. I thought it would be fun to see how many 
								movies succeeded and how many failed, so I plotted the two categories with a stacked bar chart. From there, it was a simple calculation to determine
								the percentage of movies in each month that were profitable, which is written above each bar. I don't think it's a coincidence the two highest months 
								correspond perfectly with summer break, or that the worst three months coincide with the start up of school. I guess Hollywood might be onto something
								with the invention of the Summer blockbuster, huh? 
							</p>
							<span class="image center graph" ><img src="../../images/movie_analysis/successful_movies_in_each_month.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p style="margin: 0;">
								Lastly, I looked at the genre and how that would affect a film's revenue. This feature gave me the most trouble, as each film has multiple genres 
								associated with it. In the end, I found the best results by plotting the ratio of successful to unsuccessful movies in each genre, similar to the months 
								above. With this analysis, I was able to determine the best genre to bet on a successful movie is Documentary, though that might be thrown off be the 
								small sample size avaiable. The next best genre is Horror, which I found really interesting, not being a Horror fan myself. On the flip side, History, 
								Westerns, Crime, and War Movies have less than a 50% chance of making their money back. So definitely avoid these genres if you're just looking to make 
								a quick buck! 
							</p>
							<span class="image center graph" ><img src="../../images/movie_analysis/successful_movies_in_each_genre.png" alt="" /></span>

							<p style="margin: 0;">
								So in conclusion, for all the movie producers who want to make some of their losses up, you should release a 2 hour and 15 minute Horror movie in June, 
								and pump as much money into it as you can. 
							</p>
							<br>

							<h3>Impact:</h3>
							<p>
								The impact of my study here is extremely minimal, as there are teams of professional level data scientists on staff who can tell these movie producers what 
								has worked in the past to make money. Thankfully, movies are an art form. There will never been a formula to craft the most 'succesful' movie. Because if 
								there was some perfect combination of factors, EVERY movie would fall into that niche. The people at the very top, who control and fund these projects are 
								just looking for a return on their investment.  We would loose and variety and all passion, which will destroy the entire industry.
